# ChatGPT Abdul Ghafoor (Hackathon Project)

Hey team! This is my submission for the hackathon. It's a full-featured ChatGPT clone with a custom frontend and integrated with Gemini API.

## Project Vision
I wanted to build something that felt identical to the real ChatGPT but was tailored specifically for our project requirements. I used React for the state management and Tailwind for the styling because of its speed.

## How I built this
- **React**: Used for the UI logic and session handling.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Custom dark-mode theme inspired by OpenAI's latest design.
- **Gemini 3 Flash**: Integrated this as the brain of the app for fast responses.
- **TypeScript**: Used for type safety across messages and sessions.

## Key Developer Notes
- I implemented a dynamic auto-resizing textarea for a better user experience.
- The sidebar remembers session history during the browser lifecycle.
- Avatars are customized with 'AG' (Abdul Ghafoor) and 'ME'.

## Setup
1. `npm install`
2. Add your `API_KEY` to the environment.
3. `npm start` and you are good to go!

*Built with ❤️ by Abdul Ghafoor.*
